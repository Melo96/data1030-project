    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to use machine learning methods to predict the offensive win share of a NBA player base on his shooting tendency. Win share is an advanced player stat that indicates how much a player contributes to success of his team. It is an important attribute to evaluate a player. In this project, two datasets will be used. \"Seasons_Stats.csv\" contains the basic stats of all NBA players from 1950 to 2017. \"nba_shot_types.csv\" contains data about players' shooting tendency (e.g. the ratio of a player's shots inside three point line to shots outside the three point line). The target variable would be \"ows\", which is the offensive win share of a player. It is a continuous variable, so regression model would be implemented. \n",
    "\n",
    "The topic of this project is highly related to the ongoing revolution of NBA. A lot of teams intorduced data science to game play analysis in order to improve offense and defense efficiency. They use more complex and detailed dataset to find out the most efficient offense choices, and most of the results suggest that NBA teams should encourage their players to shot more three-point and shot less mid-range jump shots. In this project, we could use simpler dataset to reproduce this analysis. "
